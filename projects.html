    <h2>Warman Competition</h2>
    <p>
        My group and I designed and built a small robot from off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts to compete against our university cohort in the <a href="https://warmandesignandbuild.org.au">Warman Competition</a>. Our team placed fourth in our university competition, producing consistent scores in both competition runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        We decided to create a robot that remained stationary in order to reduce the complexity and variability involved with moving designs. The design worked as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Laser cut carriers used carefully tensioned elastic to "slap" down on the balls and pick them up, driven by geared-down stepper motors to allow precise control of position.</li>
            <li>This deposited the balls onto our extension arms.</li>
            <li>Using a stationary design forced us to come up with a solution to extend an arm a large distance across the table in order to deposit the tennis balls in their requisite tubes. This was accomplished using aluminum extrusion and 3D printed sliders. A DC motor wound a spool that pulled tight a string running through pulleys on each segment of the arm, extending our arm to a consistent distance each time.</li>
            <li>A second string connected directly to a gate on the carrier would open the gate once it reached the desired distance, allowing the balls to roll into the tube.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Coffee Roaster</h2>
    
        For my final high school project in my Structures class, I designed and built a coffee roaster with a 1kg capacity from majority repurposed material.</li>
        The roaster featured:
            <ul>
                <li>Aluminium front and back plates.</li>
                <li>A stainless-steel drum with fins for mixing.</li>
                <li>A shawarma-style infrared LPG burner.</li>
                <li>Integrated thermocouples for monitoring bean-temp, environmental-temp, and max-environmental temp.</li>
                <li>Rimu handled bean “trier”.</li>
                <li>Front door with a glass insert for viewing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        During this project I spent a lot of time using a lathe, mill, and three-axis CNC mill along with other machinery required. I learned a lot during this project—given the chance to re-do it, I would take my learnings and apply a different approach.</li>

    <h3>Bartop Arcade Cabinet</h3>
    <p>
        Another project completed in my Structures class. I took the brief of “build a cupboard” with a grain of salt. This bar top arcade cabinet ran via a Raspberry Pi computer running emulation station software. The cabinet itself was designed in CAD, including slots for easy and precise fitting of the panels. Next, it was machined using a three-axis CNC router and then glued and screwed together.

    <h2>Mountain Bike Frame Bag</h2>
    <p>
        Sewing is a pastime of mine, mostly involving repair, though I have tried my hand at a bit of pattern making. This custom-made frame bag was made for my Trek Fuel EX, taking measurements from the frame and creating a pattern to follow the contours and diameters of the frame tubing.
        It featured:
        <ul>
            <li>Waterproof material</li>
            <li>A full length side zipper</li>
            <li>Vecro straps to secure to frame</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Rimu and Aluminium Coffee Tamper</h2>
    <p>
        This project was my introduction to using lathes for turning both metal and wood. The handle is made from rimu and attached to the aluminium base via 3 screws through the bottom. The aluminium base was machined to a diameter of 57mm and has a slight taper,  beginning one third from the bottom to reduce suction while in use.
