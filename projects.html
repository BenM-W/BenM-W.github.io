    <h2>Novel Wind Power Generation system for Antarctic Science Installations - Honours Final Year Project</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>My role was aerodynamic lead; I explored concept ideas and selected aerofoils for prototyping.</li>
            <li>Developed novel concept ideas based on aerodynamic principles including vortex shedding, lift and drag generation, and turbulence.</li>
            <li>Extensive CAD modelling in SolidWorks, including aerofoils for 3D printing and testing, parametric pulley models, and various brackets and mounts.</li>
            <li>Extensive reporting and documentation of processes, including reports, testing notes, design changes, timesheets, and a digital workbook.</li>
            <li>Testing was carried out in the university wind tunnel lab as well as through field testing in natural wind conditions; power generation, angular displacement, and wind speed data were recorded.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2> Analysis and Optimisation of a Carbon Fibre Aircraft Fuselage </h2>
    <p>
        A project for my Aerospace Structures course at university.
        <ul>
            <li>Geometry was simplified and maximum manoeuvre loads estimated for a long-range business jet.</li>
            <li>Wrote a python script (approx. 400 lines) using classical lamination theory to determine the ply stresses in a user input composite layup.</li>
            <li>Ply stresses were analysed using the Tsai-Hill failure criterium and optimised to meet a required FOS.</li>
            <li>An initial layup was determined using my python program. The model was then re-analysed using FEA in ABAQUS. The layup was further optimised based on stresses shown in the FEA model.</li>
            <li>Methodology and assumptions were documented in a 13-page report detailing: geometry, loading conditions, material properties, analytical methods, FEA meshing and boundary conditions. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Rotatory base for Wind tunnel Testing of aerofoils with leading edge tubercle</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a rotating base to interface with the wind tunnel balance and sting, allowing adjustment of aerofoil angle of attack while maintaining balance and floor rotation.</li>
            <li>Produced engineering drawings for the workshop, including shaft and hole tolerances.</li>
            <li>Main plates were waterjet cut from 10&nbsp;mm steel, and the inner rotating centre was turned to the required tolerance on the lathe.</li>
            <li>This was combined with a sting shroud to reduce aerodynamic interferance on the aerofoils being tested. This is pictured below.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Warman Competition</h2>
    <p>
        My group and I designed and built a small robot from off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts to compete against our university cohort in the <a href="https://warmandesignandbuild.org.au">Warman Competition</a>. Our team placed fourth in our university competition, producing consistent scores in both competition runs. I designed and CAD modelled various parts in SolidWorks. I also wrote all Arduino code to control stepper and DC motors, ensuring machine motion was stable and consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
        We decided to create a robot that remained stationary in order to reduce the complexity and variability involved with moving designs. The design worked as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Laser cut carriers used carefully tensioned elastic to "slap" down on the balls and pick them up, driven by geared-down stepper motors to allow precise control of position.</li>
            <li>This deposited the balls onto our extension arms.</li>
            <li>Using a stationary design forced us to come up with a solution to extend an arm a large distance across the table in order to deposit the tennis balls in their requisite tubes. This was accomplished using aluminum extrusion and 3D printed sliders. A DC motor wound a spool that pulled tight a string running through pulleys on each segment of the arm, extending our arm to a consistent distance each time.</li>
            <li>A second string connected directly to a gate on the carrier would open the gate once it reached the desired distance, allowing the balls to roll into the tube.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Coffee Roaster</h2>
    
        For my final high school project in my Structures class, I designed and built a coffee roaster with a 1kg capacity from majority repurposed material.</li>
        The roaster featured:
            <ul>
                <li>Aluminium front and back plates.</li>
                <li>A stainless-steel drum with fins for mixing.</li>
                <li>A shawarma-style infrared LPG burner.</li>
                <li>Integrated thermocouples for monitoring bean-temp, environmental-temp, and max-environmental temp.</li>
                <li>Rimu handled bean “trier”.</li>
                <li>Front door with a glass insert for viewing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        During this project I spent a lot of time using a lathe, mill, and three-axis CNC mill along with other machinery required. I learned a lot during this project—given the chance to re-do it, I would take my learnings and apply a different approach.</li>

    <h3>Bartop Arcade Cabinet</h3>
    <p>
        Another project completed in my Structures class. I took the brief of “build a cupboard” with a grain of salt. This bar top arcade cabinet ran via a Raspberry Pi computer running emulation station software. The cabinet itself was designed in CAD, including slots for easy and precise fitting of the panels. Next, it was machined using a three-axis CNC router and then glued and screwed together.

    <h2>Mountain Bike Frame Bag</h2>
    <p>
        Sewing is a pastime of mine, mostly involving repair, though I have tried my hand at a bit of pattern making. This custom-made frame bag was made for my Trek Fuel EX, taking measurements from the frame and creating a pattern to follow the contours and diameters of the frame tubing.
        It featured:
        <ul>
            <li>Waterproof material</li>
            <li>A full length side zipper</li>
            <li>Vecro straps to secure to frame</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Rimu and Aluminium Coffee Tamper</h2>
    <p>
        This project was my introduction to using lathes for turning both metal and wood. The handle is made from rimu and attached to the aluminium base via 3 screws through the bottom. The aluminium base was machined to a diameter of 57mm and has a slight taper,  beginning one third from the bottom to reduce suction while in use.
